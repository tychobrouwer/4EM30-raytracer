INSTALLATION
============


COMPILATION AND EXECUTION
=========================

Windows (VS Code) / Linux
-------------------------

* Open a terminal, go to this directory and run the Makefile: 

  ./make 
  
  This will create two executables in the directory /bin: raytracer.x and test.x
  The first executable is the actual raytracer, the second one is the unit tester.
  
* To render an image, go to the directory with the input file *.in and call the 
  executable using its complete path. For example, to render the singlePin.in 
  file in the directory /testcases/singlePin, you do:
  
  cd testcases/singlePin
  
  ../../bin/raytracer.exe singlePin.in
  
  The image will be saved in the same directory as the input file.
